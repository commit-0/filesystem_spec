    Parameters
    ----------
    source: str
        Root of the directory tree to take files from. This must be a directory, but
        do not include any terminating "/" character
    destination: str
        Root path to copy into. The contents of this location should be
        identical to the contents of ``source`` when done. This will be made a
        directory, and the terminal "/" should not be included.
    delete_missing: bool
        If there are paths in the destination that don't exist in the
        source and this is True, delete them. Otherwise, leave them alone.
    source_field: str | callable
        If ``update_field`` is "different", this is the key in the info
        of source files to consider for difference. Maybe a function of the
        info dict.
    dest_field: str | callable
        If ``update_field`` is "different", this is the key in the info
        of destination files to consider for difference. May be a function of
        the info dict.
    update_cond: "different"|"always"|"never"
        If "always", every file is copied, regardless of whether it exists in
        the destination. If "never", files that exist in the destination are
        not copied again. If "different" (default), only copy if the info
        fields given by ``source_field`` and ``dest_field`` (usually "size")
        are different. Other comparisons may be added in the future.
    inst_kwargs: dict|None
        If ``fs`` is None, use this set of keyword arguments to make a
        GenericFileSystem instance
    fs: GenericFileSystem|None
        Instance to use if explicitly given. The instance defines how to
        to make downstream file system instances from paths.

    Returns
    -------
    dict of the copy operations that were performed, {source: destination}
